    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After more then a year of inactivity, I have decided to reboot this place. And by rebooting, I mean <code>posts.all.map &amp;:destroy</code>.</p>

<p>I could have saved a couple of the older posts, but inspiration and mainly the avoidance of perspiration has influenced me to just save the bits and throw the old out.</p>

<p>It is new years and it is a bit cliché to reboot a blog but it also happens to align with a good chunk of time off. I have found the 2-weeks staycation to be very rejuvenating. I have spend the time working on the brewery (more to come), doing odd chores around the house, and getting to better know JavaScript, CoffeeScript, and Ember.</p>

<p>A couple years ago I had a similar experience where I spent a week with friends in Hawaii and a huge chunk of time with <a href="http://github.com/finack/dotfiles">my terminal setup</a>. That investment of time has gone a long way!</p>

<blockquote><p>we&rsquo;re sorry<br/>
but you&rsquo;re no longer needed<br/>
or wanted<br/>
or even cared about here <br/>
machines can do a better job than you<br/>
this is what you get for asking questions<br/>
<u>Dead Kennedys : Soup is Good Food</u></p></blockquote>

<p>So with out further ado, I christen my rebooted blog with a <a href="https://untappd.com/b/cleophus-quealy-beer-company-figgy-piggy/235867">lovely beer</a> and some salami.</p>

<p>Much gratititude to so many people who make even a meek little blog possible. It is always amazing to reflect on how much is built on the layers of OSS</p>
